# Walkthrough: Machine Learning SMS Spam Detection

## Overview
I have successfully built a complete Machine Learning project to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model training with 5 different algorithms, and comprehensive evaluation.

## Deliverables
- **Notebook**: [ml_model_project.ipynb](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/42f8cac2-b828-43a7-ae2b-d7886891c205/ml_model_project.ipynb) (Contains the full code and analysis)
- **Dataset**: [spam.csv](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/42f8cac2-b828-43a7-ae2b-d7886891c205/spam.csv) (Downloaded and ready to use)
- **Documentation**: [README.md](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/42f8cac2-b828-43a7-ae2b-d7886891c205/README.md) (Project overview and instructions)
- **Requirements**: [requirements.txt](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/42f8cac2-b828-43a7-ae2b-d7886891c205/requirements.txt) (Dependencies)

## What was Implemented

### 1. Data Pipeline
- **Loading**: Loaded [spam.csv](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/42f8cac2-b828-43a7-ae2b-d7886891c205/spam.csv) from the official repository.
- **Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 2, 3, 4`) and handled duplicates.
- **Exploration**: Visualized the distribution of Spam vs Ham messages.

### 2. Preprocessing
- **Label Encoding**: Converted targets to binary (0/1).
- **Text Vectorization**: Used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text messages into numerical features for the models.
- **Split**: 80% Training, 20% Testing.

### 3. Modeling
Trained and evaluated the following models:
1.  **Logistic Regression**
2.  **Random Forest**
3.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4.  **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
5.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

### 4. Evaluation
- Calculated **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
- Plotted a **Confusion Matrix** for the best performing model.
- Created a bar chart comparing model accuracies.

## How to Run
1.  Open the terminal in this directory.
2.  Install requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ml_model_project.ipynb
    ```
4.  Open the notebook and run all cells.

## Verification Scenarios
- **Scenario 1:** Loading the dataset works without error.
- **Scenario 2:** All 5 models train successfully.
- **Scenario 3:** The confusion matrix and accuracy plots are generated correctly.
